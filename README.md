# My first React + Typescript App
For learning purposes I'm decide rework one of my simple project for project management to React App.

## Learning curve
* Base readme from [Create React App](https://github.com/igavelyuk/red_tiger_proj_organizer/blob/master/base_fb_readme.md)
* My explanations how to start [ React + Typescript](https://github.com/igavelyuk/red_tiger_proj_organizer/blob/master/react_typescript_how_to.md)
* Installing SASS by `npm install node-sass-chokidar` and configuring "tricking" package.json

Will be added later all stuff where I've got problems and how I solve it.

## Features:
1. Name semi-automatic generator
2. Color coder
